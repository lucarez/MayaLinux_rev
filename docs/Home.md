#### What is it? ####

MayaLinux_rev is a platform based on bash to create textual adventure in bash.
It come out with three adventure based on the same challenges:
*   Maya
*   Matrix
*   Monkey Island

It means that the games are the same in type of riddles or
things to do, but differs in solutions and in themes.


#### History: ####

It borns as a MS-DOS game for an informatics competence scout camp.
Its initial name was Maya (from its theme), then with years we
changed the OS of our machines to Linux (for a more coherence with
our ethic). Porting the game its name became MayaLinux (in Italian
language sounds like pigs + linux, something like Piggux). Then we
changed the theme of the camp, and consequently of the game, in
Matrix and then in Monkey Island, but it kept the name MayaLinux.


#### Installation: ####

Rename as you please the `game` directory and move it in the desired
games folder.


#### How to play: ####

Run `mayalinux` it will ask for the language and the theme of the
game. (At the moment there is only a demo for the of the Italian
and English version of the theme *Monkey Island*)


#### How does it works: ####

MayaLinux_rev, when starts, search for available games, called theme.
Each theme has a list of levels that are based on challenges, every levels
contain the file needed form the associated challenge to run, including the
narrative text for the level.
