Mayalinux
=========
A game made to let newcomers learn some basic terminal command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

#### History: ####

It borns as a MS-DOS game for an informatic competence scout camp.
Its initial name was Maya (from its theme), then with years we
changed the OS of our machines to Linux (for a more coherence with
our ethic). Porting the game its name became Mayalinux (in Italian
language sounds like pigs + linux, something like Piggux). Then we
changed the theme of the camp, and consequently of the game, in
Matrix and then in Monkey Island, but it kept the name Mayalinux.


#### Installation: ####

Rename as you please the `game` directory and move it in the desired
games folder.


#### How to play: ####

Run `mayalinux` it will ask for the language and the theme of the
game. (At the moment there is only a demo for the of the Italian
and English version of the theme *Monkey Island*)
