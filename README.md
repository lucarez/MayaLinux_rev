Mayalinux
=========

It's a game made to let newcomers learn some basic terminal command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

History:

It born as a MS-DOS game for an informatic compentence scout camp.
Its initial name was Maya (from its theme), then with years we
changed the OS of our machines to Linux (for a more coherent ethic)
and porting the game became Mayalinux (in Italian language sounds
like pigs + linux, something like Piggix).
Than we changed the theme of the camp, and consequently of the game,
in Matrix and than in Monkey Island but it kept the name Mayalinux.


Installation:

Copy the content of the directory game in the desired game folder.


How to play:

run mayalinux using "./mayalinux" it will ask for the language and
the theme of the game (at the moment it loads automatically the
Italian version of the Monkey Island game, the only one present).
